    <h1>GGP.org Game Services</h1>

    <center><i>"Finishing games has been something I'm really proud of, seeing something through to the end." (Felicia Day)</i></center>

    <p>GGP.org game services are a collection of HTTP-based APIs that developers can use to discover
       games and download game resources for their applications.</p>
       
    <p>First, let's introduce the concept of a game repository. A game repository is a server that
       hosts a collection of games. Each game repository has its own URL. Given the URL for a game
       repository, you can discover the list of games available in that repository, and then access
       the individual games. All of the games are packaged in the same way, using a <a href="//www.ggp.org/formats/games.html">standard format</a>.
    
    <p>GGP.org hosts several game repositories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="//games.ggp.org/base/">base</a></b> - This is the main game repository for GGP.org and Tiltyard.</li>
      <li><b><a href="//games.ggp.org/dresden/">dresden</a></b> - This repository contains games imported from the Dresden GGP Server.</li>
      <li><b><a href="//games.ggp.org/stanford/">stanford</a></b> - This repository contains games imported from the Stanford Gamemaster.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>So, given the URL for a game repository, how can you discover what games are available?</p>
    
    <p>Easy: go to the "/games/" page on the game repository you're interested in. This will list
       all of the available games in that repository as a JSON list. For example, if you look at
       <a href="http://games.ggp.org/base/games/">http://games.ggp.org/base/games/</a>, you'll find
       a list that looks like this:</p>
       
    <tt>["maze", "snake_2008_tweaked", "amazons", ...</tt>
    
    <p>Okay! So let's say we'd like to get more information about the game "maze". Well, simply add that
       name onto the end of the previous URL, and look at <a href="http://games.ggp.org/base/games/maze/">http://games.ggp.org/base/games/maze/</a>,
       where you will find:</p>
       
    <tt>{"numRoles":1, "stylesheet":"maze.xsl", "rulesheet":"maze.kif", "gameName":"Maze", "roleNames":["robot"], "version":0}</tt>
    
    <p>This is the metadata about the game "maze": the name, the number of roles, and links to several important resource
       files for the game. The resources can include the game rulesheet, a visualization, a human-readable description of
       the game rules, a javascript-based user interface, and more. Let's say we want to look at the game rulesheet, because
       we'd like to run a match. To do that, we just look at the "rulesheet" entry in the JSON metadata above, and add that
       value to the end of our URL, yielding <a href="http://games.ggp.org/base/games/maze/maze.kif">http://games.ggp.org/base/games/maze/maze.kif</a>;
       and indeed, loading that page gives us the rulesheet for that game. 

    <p>Looking for a more formal specification for how game repositories work? Well, here you go.
       After the URL prefix, each game repository has a specific directory structure:</p>

    <table class="wikitable"><tbody><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> Undefined: may have any content or be inaccessible. </td></tr> <tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/games/</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> A listing of available games, as a JSON array. </td></tr> <tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/games/X/</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> Game metadata, as a JSON map, for game X. </td></tr> <tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/games/X/Y</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> A resource Y listed in the above metadata file. </td></tr> <tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/games/X/vN/</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> Game metadata for game X version N. </td></tr> <tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/games/X/vN/Y</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> A resource Y listed in the above metadata file. </td></tr> <tr><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> <tt>/A/B/C</tt> </td><td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"> A resource in the repository, referenced by another resource; can have any path. </td></tr> </tbody></table>

    <p>Game repositories provide a listing of all of their available games at <tt>/games/</tt> as a
       JSON list. For every entry <tt>X</tt> in this list, there is a metadata file provided at <tt>/games/X/</tt>
       as a JSON map, as described by the game packaging format. The other files referenced by
       the metadata file must also be in that directory. For example, if the metadata file refers
       to resource <tt>Y</tt>, that resource will be found in <tt>/games/X/Y</tt>.</p>
       
    <p>Requesting a game resource without including a version number in the URL will return the latest
       version of that resource. Metadata files include the version number, so you can determine the
       current version of a game from them. Old versions of games will continue to be available indefinitely
       so that recorded matches which refer to them will continue to be intelligible. Games will increment
       their version numbers whenever they are changed in a way that would otherwise render older matches
       unintelligible: for example, tweaks to the visualization do not require a version number increase,
       but changes to the game rules that alter the structure of the game do.</p>
