    Researchers studying general game playing are welcome to take advantage of the extensive
    GGP.org match archives, which contain <span id="match_count">250000+</span> historical matches
    across <span id="game_count">400+</span> games, involving <span id="player_count">450+</span>
    different players. The Dresden GGPServer and GGP.org's own Tiltyard server, and many smaller
    match hosts, all publish their matches into this archive.
    <br><br>
    Using the GGP.org match archives, you can answer questions like:
    <ul>
      <li>Was the average length of Connect Four matches longer in 2012 than in 2011?
      <li>What games, if any, tend to be won by the second player?
      <li>Are players who are good at Chess also good at Checkers?
      <li>Which opening moves in Nine-Board Tic-Tac-Toe were most common this month?
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Repositories</h2>

    <p>Every match in the archive is tied to a specific game version in one of the
    <a href="//games.ggp.org/">GGP.org game repositories</a>: this association is done
    by URL, so the rules of a game aren't repeated in each of the thousands of matches
    that use it.</p>
    
    <p>Do you suspect that the first player tends to win matches of Checkers? Are you curious
    whether matches of Connect Four tend to take longer than games of Reversi? Find answers
    based on real data about thousands of actual recorded matches of these exact games.</p>
