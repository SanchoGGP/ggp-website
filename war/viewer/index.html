    <p>Welcome to the experimental new GGP.org Viewer (codenamed Bellerophon). This is a unified
       viewing interface for all GGP content (players, games, matches, aggregate statistics) spanning
       multiple game repositories, multiple spectator servers, multiple match hosts, etc. All of this
       content can be viewed on a per-host or global basis, paving the way for having player statistics
       based on matches played on many different hosts (not yet possible because right now a player's
       identity is tied to the host they're playing matches on, but we can build a future where that's
       no longer the case).</p>
    <p>For example, you can view matches played on
        <a href="/view/apollo/matches/">Apollo</a>,
        <a href="/view/dresden/matches/">Dresden</a>,
        or <a href="/view/all/matches/">both</a>, all in the same interface.</p>
    <p>This interface is still in-development. Please file bug reports.</p>
