    <h2>What is General Game Playing?</h2>
    <p>General game playing is a field of artificial intelligence which studies
how to build programs that can play games. There is a long and varied history
of humans building artificial gamers, from the Mechanical Turk back in the 1770s
to modern chess-playing computers like Deep Blue that have beaten the human world
chess champions. Artificial intelligence work has long focused on computer programs
that play specific games, and such programs can handily defeat human opponents
on games ranging from Connect Four to Chess.</p>

    <p>Computer programs designed to play specific games traditionally have the
rules of the game hard-coded in, along with <q>heuristics</q> that allow the
programs to evaluate whether a particular state of the game is good or not.
Such programs look ahead in the game tree, and choose their moves so as to
eventually reach states with high heuristic values. This constant search for
high-value states will lead the programs to continually improve their position,
and, if everything goes according to plan, ultimately win the game.</p>

    <p>While these programs play their games effectively, one might question whether
they are really <q>intelligent</q>. The real work involved in understanding the game
and its strategy has already been done even before the program begins running:
the gamers are merely following strategies and heuristics that their original
programmers devised. This demonstrates that the original programmers understand the
game, but it doesn't demonstrate that the programs themselves really understand 
the game in a meaningful way.</p>

    <p><b>General game playing is about building computer programs which can play
any arbitrary game.</b> These programs are written without knowing the games
they are playing in advance, and so they have to be able to play any game that
they are presented with. Chess programs can only play chess; checkers programs
can only play checkers; but a general game playing program can play any game.</p>

  <h2>How can it play any game?</h2>
  
  <p>At the beginning of a match, the general game playing program is sent the rules
  of the game. These rules are encoded in a logic language called the "Game Description
  Language", which is based on first order logic. The GDL description of the game
  specifies only the rules of the game: the game playing program's task is to read in
  these rules and decide on a strategy.</p>
