    Developers building general game playing systems can benefit from open source
    projects hosted by GGP.org: they can build players and servers using the libraries
    in <b>GGP Base</b>, and they can test their players and publish matches online
    using <b>GGP Galaxy</b> online services like Tiltyard.

    <h2>GGP Base</h2>

    <iframe style="float: right; width: 35%; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-sU8doqVfiQ41jkDG41oUPC4TRAbH8HdUaa7pQYJiXo/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="749" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
    
    <p>GGP Base is a set of libraries and applications in Java that assist with the
       development of GGP players by providing a common infrastructure to base work on.
       GGP Base handles the mechanical aspects of communicating with the match host,
       parsing GDL, representing the game as a state machine, determining which moves
       are legal, and so on. Developers using GGP Base can focus on writing innovative
       gaming algorithms.</p>

    <p>GGP Base also provides useful tools for writing games and testing gamers.
       This includes programs to verify that rulesheets contain legal GDL, programs to
       visualize matches and let humans easily interact with gamers, programs to
       automatically run large sets of matches between gamers and analyze the results,
       and so on. Development, testing, and visualization tools built using the GGP Base
       can benefit everybody using it.</p>

    <h2>GGP Galaxy</h2>
    
    <p>All of the online services hosted on GGP.org are part of the "GGP Galaxy"
       project, which aims to bring general game playing to a wider audience through
       the use of web technologies. That includes <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy/source/browse/trunk/ggp-website/war/developers/index.html">
       this page</a>.
       
    <p>Developers can use the GGP.org services to access large repositories of games,
       publish matches so they can be viewed online, subscribe to feeds of match results,
       and so on.</p>
