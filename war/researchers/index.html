    Researchers studying general game playing are welcome to take advantage of the extensive
    GGP.org match archives, which contain <span id="match_count">250000+</span> historical matches
    across <span id="game_count">400+</span> games, involving <span id="player_count">450+</span>
    different players. The Dresden GGPServer and GGP.org's own Tiltyard server, and many smaller
    match hosts, all publish their matches into this archive.
    <br><br>
    Using the GGP.org match archives, you can answer questions like:
    <ul>
      <li>What were the most popular opening moves in Connect Four in 2012? What about 2011?    
      <li>What was the average length of Nine-Board Tic-Tac-Toe matches this month?
      <li>What games, if any, tend to be won by the second player?
      <li>Are players who are good at Chess also good at Checkers?
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Repositories</h2>

    <p>Every match in the archive is tied to a specific game version in one of the
    <a href="//games.ggp.org/">GGP.org game repositories</a>: this association is done
    by URL, so the rules of a game aren't repeated in each of the thousands of matches
    that use it.</p>
    
    <p>Do you suspect that the first player tends to win matches of Checkers? Are you curious
    whether matches of Connect Four tend to take longer than games of Reversi? Find answers
    based on real data about thousands of actual recorded matches of these exact games.</p> 
        
    <h2>Match Archives</h2>

    <h2>Example Analysis</h2>
    
    <p>So you've downloaded a bulk archive of historical matches. What now?</p>
    
    <p>Let's look at an example of an analysis that you might run. This example will use
       the <a href="//stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> JSON processor command line tool. You
       can do similar things using the built-in JSON library in Python. Similar tools exist
       for many other languages.</p>
       
    <p>Say we want to know which opening moves are most popular in Connect Four. Let's also
       consider only matches signed by the hosting system, so we know where they came from.
       This can be done with the following command:</p>
       
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #f8f8f8; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">$</span> cat matchesFrom2012 | jq <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;if .data.gameMetaURL == &quot;http://games.ggp.org/base/games/connectFour/v0/&quot; and .data.matchHostPK != null then .data.moves[0][0] else null end&#39;</span> | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c</pre></div>
    
    <p>Before we run this, how does it work? First, it lists all of the matches from 2012.
       For every match where Connect Four was played, and a signature was recorded, we output
       the first move for the first player. For every other match, we output null. Then we drop
       all of the nulls. Then we sort the output, and print out a count for each unique entry:
       a histogram, essentially.</p>
       
    <p>Okay, let's run that command:</p>
    
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #f8f8f8; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">$</span> cat matchesFrom2012 | jq <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;if .data.gameMetaURL == &quot;http://games.ggp.org/base/games/connectFour/v0/&quot; and .data.matchHostPK != null then .data.moves[0][0] else null end&#39;</span> | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c
<span style="color: #888888">    340 &quot;( drop 1 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">    356 &quot;( drop 2 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">    357 &quot;( drop 3 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1672 &quot;( drop 4 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1644 &quot;( drop 5 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">    333 &quot;( drop 6 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">    311 &quot;( drop 7 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">    321 &quot;( drop 8 )&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

    <p>Success! And best of all, these results make sense -- the two center columns are the strongest
       opening plays in Connect Four, and this confirms that they're chosen most frequently. Also, since
       the game is symmetric, it makes sense that there's a symmetric distribution of opening moves.</p>
    
    <p>Let's compare that result with the distribution of opening moves for Connect Four from 2011.</p>
    
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #f8f8f8; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">$</span> cat matchesFrom2011 | jq <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;if .data.gameMetaURL == &quot;http://games.ggp.org/base/games/connectFour/v0/&quot; and .data.matchHostPK != null then .data.moves[0][0] else null end&#39;</span> | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c
<span style="color: #888888">   1447 &quot;( drop 1 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1413 &quot;( drop 2 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1446 &quot;( drop 3 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1592 &quot;( drop 4 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1506 &quot;( drop 5 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1400 &quot;( drop 6 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1478 &quot;( drop 7 )&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #888888">   1470 &quot;( drop 8 )&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
   
    <p>That's different! What happened?</p>
    
    <p>Well, to begin with, there are similarities between 2011 and 2012. The distributions of
       observed moves are roughly symmetric in both. And both have a peak in the center, for the
       moves we know to be stronger. But in 2012 the peak is much more pronounced than in 2011.
       It's almost as though the players in 2012 were noticeably better than those in 2011...</p>
       
    <p>... and indeed, that's true. For the majority of 2011, there were several robot players on
       Tiltyard playing randomly, doing load testing of the hosting, publishing, archiving, etc.
       These random players were shut off once real players began to play on Tiltyard consistently.
       That change explains the sudden improvement in the choice of opening moves in Connect Four
       between 2011 and 2012. This can be confirmed by looking at the data for 2013, which matches
       the data for 2012.</p> 
       
    <p>Thus concludes our first discovery based on the historical match archives!</p>
