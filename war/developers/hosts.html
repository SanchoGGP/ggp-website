    <h1>Developing Match Hosts</h1>
    
    <center><i>"The only legitimate use of a computer is to play games." (Eugene Jarvis)</i></center>

    <p>Hosting a match involves a lot of moving pieces. You need to find a game, and find
    players that are ready to play. Once you have those, you need to communicate with the
    players, handle timeouts and illegal moves, track the state of the match, and publish
    it somewhere, so everyone can easily view it.</p>
    
    <p>Fortunately, it's easy to get started, with the help of GGP.org projects.</p>
    
    <h2>Building upon GGP Base</h2>
    
    <p>GGP Base is a set of Java libraries and apps that help you build GGP match hosts.
       It provides a common infrastructure to build on, taking care of busy work
       like communicating with players, parsing GDL rules, representing the game as a
       state machine, determining which moves are legal, and so on.       
    
    <p>GGP Base also includes built-in support for publishing to the GGP.org matches service,
       so that everyone involved can view the match online as it happens, and so researchers can
       include it when doing bulk analyses of the historical match archives.</p>    
       
    <h2>Publishing via the GGP.org Matches Service</h2>
    
    <p>The <a href="//www.ggp.org/services/matches.html">GGP.org Matches Service</a> lets you easily
       publish matches to GGP.org, making it possible to watch them live in the GGP.org viewer, and
       adding them to the historical match archives. If you're using GGP Base, it includes built-in
       support for publishing matches to GGP.org; otherwise, you can use an HTTP POST request to directly
       send matches to GGP.org for publishing.</p>
       
    <p>Furthermore, if you sign all of your matches using a unique cryptographic key, GGP.org will be able
       to identify that they all came from the same hosting system, and will compute statistics for the players
       on your server, display a timeline of the most recently played matches, and do many other useful things.
       To see this in effect for a match hosting system that's not based on GGP Base, look at the GGP.org viewer
       pages for the <a href="//www.ggp.org/view/dresden/matches/">Dresden GGP Server</a>.</p>
       
    <p>This is the same service that Tiltyard uses to publish matches!</a>
