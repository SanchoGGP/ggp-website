    Developers building general game playing systems can benefit from open source
    projects hosted by GGP.org: you can build players and servers using the libraries
    in <b>GGP Base</b>, and you can test your players and publish matches online
    using <b>GGP Galaxy</b> online services like Tiltyard.

    <h2>GGP Base</h2>

    <p>GGP Base is a set of Java libraries and apps that help you build GGP players.
       It provides a common infrastructure to build on, taking care of busy work
       like communicating with match hosting systems, parsing GDL, representing the
       game as a state machine, determining which moves are legal, and so on.       
    
    <p>GGP Base also includes tools for writing games and testing gamers. You can use
       these tools to verify that rulesheets contain legal GDL and describe valid games,
       to visualize and participate in matches, and to automatically run many matches between
       gamers and analyze the results.</p>    
       
    <p>When you use GGP Base to build your player, you focus on what's really important:
       coming up with novel ways to analyze games and choose the best moves. GGP Base
       takes care of the rest.</p>
        
    <p>Get started building your own player using GGP Base using
       <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rm_sjou46e4FlbrheCaoig21CkV0eJPexavRhT09YUA/edit?usp=sharing">this tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2>GGP Galaxy</h2>
    
    <p>All of the online services hosted on GGP.org are part of the "GGP Galaxy"
       project, which aims to bring general game playing to a wider audience through
       the use of web technologies. That includes <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy/source/browse/trunk/ggp-website/war/developers/index.html">
       this page</a>.
       
    <p>Developers can use the GGP.org services to access large repositories of games,
       publish matches so they can be viewed online, subscribe to feeds of match results,
       and so on.</p>
