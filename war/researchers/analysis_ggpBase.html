    <p>So, we've <a href="//www.ggp.org/researchers/analysis_agonRating.html">computed player ratings</a>
       by processing match archives using a Python script. That's great, but for many developers coming from
       using <a href="https://github.com/ggp-org/ggp-base">GGP Base</a> and building players in Java, it raises
       the question: can we do similar match processing using the tools we're already comfortable with,
       in GGP Base?</p>
       
    <p>The answer is yes. The org.ggp.base.apps.research package contains an example program that reads
       a serialized match archive and processes each individual match. The example program that's included
       with GGP Base aggregates several useful statistics during this processing, that can be used to answer
       interesting questions about the matches in the archive.</p>
    
    <p>Let's start with something easy: how long does the average nine-board tic-tac-toe match last? To compute
       this, we introduce a WeightedAverage object to track the average length of the matches, and as we process
       each match, for the completed nine-board tic-tac-toe matches, we extract the length and add it as a data
       point in the weighted average. At the end of the processing, we display the WeightedAverage object. Done!</p>
       
    <p>Next, let's look at the frequency that games are played. For each match in the archive, the sample program
       adds a data point to a histogram that tracks how frequently each game is played. After all of the matches
       are processed, it sorts the histogram and prints it out. This makes it easy to see which games are played
       most frequently and which are played least frequently.</p>
       
    <p>That's cool, but what if we have a very specific question? Let's say we're interested in finding out whether
       there are any games that tend to be won by the second player, rather than the first. To do this, we can find
       out for each match, whether the second player won, and then aggregate an average of those scores broken down
       by game. This is done using the "FrequencyTable" class, which is essentially a table that maps keys (in this
       case, game URLs) to weighted averages (in this case, frequencies that the second player wins). And again, after
       processing all of the matches, we can sort them by frequency and print out a list that shows, for each game,
       the frequency that the second player wins. Intriguingly, games like "endgame" top the list, even though "endgame"
       is a chess puzzle in which the first player (white) has a king and a rook and the second player (black) has only
       a king: while in theory white has a win, black will win if white isn't able to achieve checkmate in 15 moves, and
       so in practice the game is frequently won by black.</p>
       
    <p>Thus, using the tools available in GGP Base, you can perform sophisticated processing of the match archives
       to answer interesting questions, using all of the Java tools that you're already familiar with.</p>
