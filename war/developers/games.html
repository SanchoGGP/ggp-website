    <h1>Developing Games</h1>
    
    <center><i>"The only legitimate use of a computer is to play games." (Eugene Jarvis)</i></center>    
    
    <p>Games are, unsurprisingly, an essential part of general game playing. In a broad sense,
    general game playing involves building computer programs that can devise strategies and
    carry out plans to accomplish goals. Games provide an environment with goals, and with
    choices that must be made while trying to achieve those goals. Our computer programs would
    be listless and unhappy without games. So it's up to us to give them games to play.</p>
    
    <h2>Game Description Language</h2>
    
    <p>Games are written in a logic language called the Game Description Language (GDL).
    We use the GDL to describe which facts are true at each state of the game; how those
    facts determine which moves--if any--a player can make; and how the facts of the game
    state change when players make moves. For the official language spec, please see the
    <a href="http://games.stanford.edu/games/gdl.html">most recent official writeup</a>.
    I also highly recommend
    <a href="http://alloyggp.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-game-description-language.html">this
    blog post</a> which provides more details, examples, and discussion of GDL.</p>
    
    <h2>Writing Game Rules</h2>
    
    <p>I defer to <a href="http://alloyggp.blogspot.com/2013/01/writing-game-with-gdl-sim.html">
    this blog post</a> on writing new games, and <a href="http://alloyggp.blogspot.com/2013/04/rewriting-checkers.html">
    this blog post</a> on optimizing existing games.</p>
        
    <h2>Packaging Games in Repositories</h2>
    
    <p>Games aren't just rules: they have names, instructions, visualizations, user interfaces,
    contact information for their authors and maintainers, and so on. And nobody's perfect, so
    occasionally old rules will turn out to be broken or unfair, and a new version of the rules
    will be developed to supersede them. And if many people are all comparing their results on
    a particular game, it's useful for them to have a universal identifier for that game which
    they can use to refer to it, and distinguish it from other similar games in the same family.
    All of this is managed by "game repositories."</p>
    
    <p>Game repositories are servers containing collections of packaged games. Packaged games
    start with a metadata object, which contains simple information like the name and version
    of the game, as well as links to files containing essential game content: the rules, the
    instructions, the visualizations, the user interfaces, and so on. See the
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy/wiki/Fed0_Repositories">full specification</a>
    for more details about packaging and game repositories. Or <a href="//games.ggp.org/">explore</a>
    a game repository and see what's inside. Curious about why they're organized the way they are?
    Read a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy/wiki/Repository_Servers">writeup</a> that
    discusses the thinking behind packaging and game repositories.</p>
    
    <p>Many of the game validation tools in GGP Base depend on having your game properly packaged
    and hosted on a game repository. This is easy to set up: just create a folder for your game in
    the "games/games/" directory, put the rulesheet in that directory, and create a file called
    METADATA that includes the game name and points to the rulesheet. This will add your game to
    the local game repository. See the existing versions of Connect Four and Tic-Tac-Toe that are
    already in this repository as examples.</p>
    
    <h2>Validating Games</h2>
    
    <p>Once your game has been added to the local game repository, you can run the Validator app,
    select the "Local Game Repository" as your source of games, and choose your game from the list.
    This app will run a number of validation steps to identify any possible problems in the game.
    For example, if the game has a state where a player doesn't have any legal moves, but the game
    isn't over, that's a validation error: that will never happen in a well-formed game. Likewise,
    if a game has states where the game is over but a player isn't assigned a score, that's another
    validation error. The Validator app isn't guaranteed to find all validation errors, but you should
    fix any errors that it does find.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend the article <a href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml">Defining the Abstract</a>
    when thinking about how to develop excellent games for general game playing.</p>
